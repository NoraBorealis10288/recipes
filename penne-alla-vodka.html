    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description long">A dish which consists purely of sauced pasta, this dish quickly became the poster child dish of 'you have no idea how long it takes to make a good sauce from scratch until you have to wait for alchohol to cook out of it.' Speaking from personal experience, the answer is about 3.5-4 hours.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div class="ingredients">
      <ul>
        <li><b>1 (28oz) can</b> whole peeled tomatoes (San Marzano recommended)</li>
        <li><b>2 tbsp</b> olive oil</li>
        <li><b>3 oz</b> pancetta, diced</li>
        <li><b>½ cup</b> onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li><b>2 cloves</b> garlic, finely minced</li>
        <li><b>¼ tsp</b> crushed red pepper</li>
        <li><b>3 tbsp</b> tomato paste</li>
        <li><b>⅔ cup</b> vodka</li>
        <li><b>1 lb</b> penne pasta</li>
        <li><b>1 cup</b> heavy cream</li>
        <li><b>¼ tsp</b> pepper</li>
        <li><b>⅔ cup</b> parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
        <li><b>2 tbsp</b> parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li><b>3 tbsp</b> fresh basil, chopped</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol class="directions">
      <li>Place a large pot of salted water over high heat to bring to a boil. Pour tomatoes in a medium bowl and crush well with hands or chop in a food processor. Set aside.</li>
      <li>While water heats, prepare the sauce: Heat oil and pancetta in a large saucepan or deep skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring frequently until pancetta is crisp, about 5 minutes. Add onion and cook, stirring constantly, until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring often, until the tomato paste has taken on a slight brownish color, 2 to 3 minutes. Add vodka and cook until reduced by at least half. Stir in reserved tomatoes and juices and bring mixture to a simmer. Reduce heat and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>While sauce reduces, add pasta to boiling water and cook, according to package directions until al dente, 9 to 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Once sauce is reduced, stir in heavy cream and pepper and cook for 3 minutes, stirring often. Stir in 1/3 cup cheese, parsley, basil and pasta until well combined. Season with additional salt and pepper if desired.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle with remaining cheese and more herbs, if desired, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
