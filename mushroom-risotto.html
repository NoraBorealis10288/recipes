    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description short">You got the rice, the mushrooms, the wine, I mean it's risotto, what more could you want? Fuggetaboutit.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div class="ingredients">
      <ul>
        <li><b>1 ounce</b> dried porcini mushrooms</li>
        <li><b>1 cup</b> hot water</li>
        <li><b>1 (32 ounce) carton</b> beef stock</li>
        <li><b>¼ cup</b> olive oil</li>
        <li><b>3 cloves</b> garlic</li>
        <li><b>1 tsp.</b> dried rosemary</li>
        <li>salt & pepper to taste</li>
        <li><b>1 cup</b> white wine, divided</li>
        <li><b>¼ cup</b> butter, divided</li>
        <li><b>1</b> shallot, chopped</li>
        <li><b>1¾ cups</b> arborio rice</li>
        <li><b>⅓ cup</b> parmesan cheese, grated</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol class="directions">
        <li>Place porcini mushrooms in a bowl and cover with hot water. Let soak until soft, about 1 hour. Drain, reserving soaking liquid. Squeeze mushrooms to remove excess water and roughly chop.</li>
        <li>Bring beef stock to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to low and cover to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic cloves; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook and stir until soft, 5 to 6 minutes. Season with rosemary, salt, and pepper. Discard garlic cloves; pour in 1/2 cup wine. Increase heat to medium-high and simmer until wine reduces, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil with 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir shallot until soft, about 3 minutes. Cook and stir Arborio rice until toasted and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Pour in remaining 1/2 cup wine. Simmer until wine is absorbed, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Ladle 1/3 of the warm stock into the saucepan; cook and stir until absorbed. Ladle in remaining stock and reserved soaking liquid in small amounts and cook, stirring constantly, until risotto is tender and creamy, 15 to 18 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove risotto from the heat; stir in remaining 2 tablespoons butter and Parmesan cheese. Let stand for 3 to 5 minutes before serving.</li>
